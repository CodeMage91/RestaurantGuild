                <h3>The Legend of the Restaurant Guild</h3>
                <img src="../IMG/tavern.png" style="width:320px">
                <p> 
                    Deep within the mysterious and treacherous Darkwood Forest, where sunlight struggles to pierce
                    the canopy and whispers of lost adventurers echo through the trees, hope takes the form of an
                    irresistible aroma. For those brave—or fortunate—enough to follow the scent, salvation awaits at
                    the Restaurant Guild, a sanctuary of warmth, hearty meals, and guidance for weary travelers.
                    But the tale of this tavern is as remarkable as the Darkwood itself. Long ago, an adventurer prince
                    wandered into the forest, lost and on the brink of despair. As fate would have it, his path crossed
                    with that of a mighty dragon, a beast whose hunger knew no bounds. The dragon loomed over the
                    prince, ready to claim him as its next meal. In a moment of desperation—and perhaps brilliance—the prince made a bold offer. “Spare me,” he
                    said, “and I will prove that I am the greatest cook in all the land. Allow me to prepare you a meal,
                    and if you find it unworthy, you may devour me instead.”
                    The dragon, intrigued and amused by the prince's audacity, agreed. <br>
                    <img src="../IMG/prince_dragon.png" style="width: 420px">
                   <br>
                    With trembling hands and a
                    flicker of hope, the prince set to work. From the sparse ingredients he carried, he crafted a dish so
                    divine it could make even the most stoic elf weep—a perfectly seasoned eggplant burger.
                    The dragon's fiery gaze softened with each bite, its ferocious appetite replaced by sheer delight.
                    “You will not be my meal,” the dragon rumbled, “but neither shall you leave. From this day forward,
                    you will cook for me and all who dare to tread the Darkwood.”
                    Thus, the Restaurant Guild was born. The prince, now its manager, serves adventurers from every
                    corner of the realm, offering them respite from the dangers of the forest. And while the prince
                    creates culinary wonders, the dragon watches over the tavern, ensuring that no harm befalls its
                    patrons—or their meals.
                    To this day, the smell of the prince's legendary cooking continues to guide lost souls to safety.
                    Adventurers come to the Restaurant Guild to savor its magical dishes, regain their strength, and
                    discover their next path. But be warned: the dragon is very much real, and it doesn’t take kindly to
                    poor manners... or picky eaters.</p>
